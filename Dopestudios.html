    <h3>
        Knightbane is a Hack and Slash Action RPG where you play as Atlas, a knight learning their way around Ozarink City.The game blends narrative depth with fluid action gameplay. The game follows Atlas, a solitary knight navigating the shifting depths of Ozarink City — a mysterious, lore-rich setting full of conflict, forgotten magic, and emerging chaos.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Atlas, the tride and true, arguable “hero” of Ozarink. Our hero is cocky, stubborn, shy, but adamant on their goals. They wear their dad’s jacket, and the mask is an old antique from the days of the Schism
    </p>

    <p>
       Ozarink started as a fishing town, nothing but docks, canals, and the few humble people that lived there. As the fish got bigger, so did the city. With the new boom however, came in a plethora of new people. They all got along well, but with the new blooming population came a new hostility of who rightfully owned the city. Soon, they all agreed that whoever could raise the strongest warrior, and win in a battle against the others, would be the race to win the city. In the final battle, demons overpowered the humans, but in the last moment, the knight of Ozarink stood once more, held a musket to the demons back, and fired the shrapnel through his chest. The humans won, only due to the advances in technology. Ages past, over 450 years later, Ozarink city has become a booming metropolis, the days of fishing for measly coins long gone. The city grew a little too far for its own good though, the citizens often occupying the old and decrepit office buildings of days long over.

    <p>
      Soon, a demon arose from amongst the concrete jungle, offering the booming metropolis one simple goal: Find who is the strongest, and kill the strongest human, to set the wrongs right of the past millenia. Bazlin scourged the city, finding fights anywhere he could. Bazlin found four pillars in which he could truly expect a good battle, but none of them could surpass each other. Their names were Grimm, Lucien, Shiro, and Aizen, and for years, they would remain under Bazlin’s authority, waiting for someone to finally beat them. (Each of these 5 bosses control an area that you discover) This is where KnightBane’s story truly starts, after the schism Ozarink was left in dismay, struggling for power, and only the strongest survived, and now, you, under the character of Atlas, fight your way through this wicked world and build a legacy for yourself.

KnightBane as a project has been in development since February 16 2024, and has been developed slowly over the past two years. The game started in Godot, but soon switched to Unity engine, and all models are made in Blender. The Music is composed in FL Studio, and all of the work is done by a small team of 3 main people.
